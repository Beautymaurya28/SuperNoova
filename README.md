##  About Me
Hey! I'm **Beauty**, an aspiring full-stack developer with a deep curiosity for:
-  Web Development
-  AI / Machine Learning
-  DevOps & Cloud
-  Data Structures & Algorithms

I come from a background where exams were cancelled, and marks were *given without effort*.  
But now? **I'm building everything from scratch â€” with code, courage, and consistency.**
