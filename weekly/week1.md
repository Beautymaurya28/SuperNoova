Nova’s Weekly Reflection – Week 1 

What I did great this week:
- Completed Day 1 for DSA/Web/DevOps
- Consistent GitHub push + first bash script

 What I struggled with:
- CSS layout alignment (hero image was breaking)
- DSA question logic took time

 What I’ll fix next week:
- Practice 1 more prefix sum Q daily
- Convert hero to Tailwind for cleaner code

 What I’m proud of:
- Built my first UI component alone 
- Didn’t give up on tricky DSA logic
