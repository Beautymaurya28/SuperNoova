## What I Learned with Explanation

### DevOps Basics

#### Difference between Development & Operations

- **Development (Dev)** focuses on writing code, building features, and pushing updates.
- **Operations (Ops)** handles the infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, and uptime of applications.

Traditionally, these teams worked in silos, causing miscommunication and delays. DevOps bridges the gap, enabling faster and smoother releases.

#### DevOps Lifecycle

**Stages**: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Monitor

- **Plan** – Define product goals and user stories.
- **Code** – Develop features based on the plan.
- **Build** – Convert source code into executable artifacts.
- **Test** – Validate builds through manual or automated tests.
- **Release** – Approve and package the build for deployment.
- **Deploy** – Push the build to production or staging environments.
- **Monitor** – Continuously observe system health and performance.

DevOps promotes automation across all stages to increase efficiency and reduce human error.

#### Why DevOps is Important in SDLC

- Enables Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Reduces time-to-market
- Improves collaboration between teams
- Enhances software quality and stability
- Provides faster feedback loops

### Linux Essentials

#### What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system used widely in servers, DevOps workflows, cloud infrastructure, and containers. It comes in different distributions such as Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, etc.

#### Common Linux Commands

| Command   | Purpose                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `pwd`     | Print current directory                |
| `ls`      | List directory contents                |
| `cd`      | Change directory                       |
| `mkdir`   | Create new directory                   |
| `touch`   | Create new empty file                  |
| `rm`      | Remove files or directories            |
| `nano`    | Terminal-based text editor             |
| `vim`     | Advanced terminal-based text editor    |
| `cat`     | Display file content                   |
| `chmod`   | Change file or directory permissions   |
| `chown`   | Change file or directory ownership     |

Command-line skills are essential for automation, scripting, and server management.

#### Linux File Permissions

Linux defines permissions for:
- **User (owner)**
- **Group**
- **Others**

Permission types:
- `r` – Read
- `w` – Write
- `x` – Execute

Useful commands:
- `ls -l` – View file permissions
- `chmod` – Modify permissions
- `chown` – Change file ownership

Understanding permissions is crucial for securing files and directories in multi-user environments.

### Hands-On Tasks Completed

- Created folders and files using `mkdir` and `touch`
- Used `nano` to write basic cheat sheets
- Navigated and managed file system with `cd`, `ls`, and `rm`
- Practiced permission modifications using `chmod`, `chown`, and `ls -l`
