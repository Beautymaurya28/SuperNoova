# Day 1 – Sorting Shuru | DSA Placement Prep 
 Date: 13th May, 2025 |  Mode: Supernova Execution ON  
Hello future me! Aaj se maine officially DSA journey start ki... aur shuruaat hui **Sorting** se   
Let’s gooo

##  What I Learned Today

###  Sorting – What & Why?
Sorting = Cheezein ek order mein laana (asc/desc)  
Har jagah use hota hai — from leaderboards to online shopping filters.

##  Types of Sorting  
| Type               | Examples                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
|  Comparison-Based | Bubble, Selection, Insertion |
|  Non-Comparison   | Counting, Radix           |

##  Quick Complexity Check

| Algorithm         | Best     | Avg      | Worst    |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Bubble Sort       | O(n)     | O(n²)    | O(n²)    |
| Selection Sort    | O(n²)    | O(n²)    | O(n²)    |
| Insertion Sort    | O(n)     | O(n²)    | O(n²)    |

 **Observation**: Insertion is useful for nearly sorted arrays. Bubble is chill for concept building, but not optimal.

## Visualized + Dry Run Kiya:
✅ Bubble Sort – like pushing biggest element to end  
✅ Selection Sort – pick smallest & fix it  
✅ Insertion Sort – apne jagah dhundhne wala bande jaisa

##  Outcome of the Day

 Sorting ke concept solid  
 Dry-run se samjha kaise kaam karta hai  
 Brute force → optimized approach ka feel aaya  
 Edge cases ka handling kaafi clear ho gaya  
 Time complexity + use-case mapping bhi mast samjha

## Note to Self

Sorting is the base of almost everything in DSA.  
Aaj ka din productivity full  
**Let’s keep this streak alive! One day = One weapon added in brain arsenal **
