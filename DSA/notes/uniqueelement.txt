In this we ill use xor opeartor why?
because when we xor(^) in same element
 then same number will cancel out like if we do 3^3= it will give 0 
 because both number are same.


 and if we xor between different element like 4^0=4

 so:
 1.same number cancel out.
 2.XOR with zero gives the number itself.

 like if we have 1,2,1,3,2,3,4,5,5 the ans will be 4.
