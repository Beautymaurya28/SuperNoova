in the case of array we give base address(starting addressof the array not actual) to the next function not variables
 that's why it didn't make copies  it store the base address of the name variable 
 so whatever changes we will do in this addres it will affect our main address 
 element so that in this update function when we are changing the 2 index element 
 it is affection the main array also becuase it update are storing the address of main.
